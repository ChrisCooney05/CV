### A bit about me
After years of wanting to learn how to code but not sure how to go about it, I decided quit my job of 5 years, joined [Makers](https://makers.tech/) ( a 12 week intensive Bootcamp ) and here I am fresh off the press, a full-stack developer!<br/><br/>
**Why I'm not your standard developer**<br/><br/> 
I bring a wide spectrum of experience with me, from managing staff, picking products, working with clients to achieve their goals, developing products, or helping people look good on there wedding day. This diverse background has helped me built great people skills, the ability to work in all kinds of situations, and the ability to quickly adapt. Programming is no longer a career choice but a passion for me, my [github profile](https://github.com/ChrisCooney05) will prove this and show my commitment to constantly looking for new projects and things to learn<br/><br/>
**Why should you employ me?**<br/><br/> 
I have proven that I'm driven, have a strong technical mind and a fast learner by moving away from a stable job and learning several different languages, frameworks, and concepts in 12 weeks, to the level that I am confident I can produce quality applications.<br/>
I'm also confident in my ability to learn new languages, frameworks, and procedures quickly and effectively should it be needed.

## Skills

- **Team player** - I have played all types of team sports since before I can remember and was even fortunate enough to play AFL for England and Great Britain, because of this I feel at home being in a team of any size in any capacity. Whether that is taking a back seat and getting my head down, helping others, or being at the front and leading. 

- **Fast learner/ Adaptable** - Over the last 3 months with Makers I have had to learn and use several different languages, frameworks, and concepts. Not only this, but the languages and frameworks changed weekly sometimes even at different levels of software development. Because of this, I am confident that I can learn new skills and adapt to any changes quickly and effectively.

- **Problem solver** - In my spare time I enjoy gaming, especially games that have puzzle elements to them. Because of this, I feel like I have spent the best part of 18 years training my problem-solving skills. I often think outside of the box for solutions and love to find ways to make solutions as optimal as possible
