### A bit about me

I'm a junior full stack developer in training fuelled by both excitement and caffeine. self motivated and hard working with a thirst for knowledge.

After spending the last 5 years working for a retail display and packaging company I was ready to take on the next big challenge. My biggest motivators are learning something new and seeing a project come to life. watching people interact with something I have helped develop gives me that little fist pump feeling and a satisfaction that can’t be described. 

I consider myself a Jack of all trades but ready to become the master of one.

*Assistant Manager*
As the Assistant Manager I was predominately tasked with being the face of the store. I needed to develop strong relationships with customers to ensure repeat custom. Along side this Slaters offered free alterations, so I was to pin, measure and document any changes that need to be made accurately.
