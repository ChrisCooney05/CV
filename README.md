### A bit about me
Fun fact, after years of wanting to learn how to code, but telling myself "programming is magic and there is no way you could understand it" I decided, I fancy learning me some of this magic, loved it, quit my job of 5 years, joined [Makers](https://makers.tech/) and here I am fresh of the press a software developer!
Two things are nearly always on my mind. What shall I learn next? and what shall I have for dinner? one less important than the other, but both important to understand how my mind works. 
I want to find a position that will help answer one of those questions and offer a place where I can learn, grow and blossom into the developer im sure I can become.

## Experience

**Key Account Manager - Wine Box Company T/A WBC LTD** (October 2014 - April 2020)    
  
I started with WBC as part time member of the warehouse team. Over the next 3 years I worked myself through a number of rolls until I was promoted to Key Account Manager. I was responsible for working closely with clients, understanding briefs and delivering product that met quality, specification and budget. 

**Traveling around South-East Asia and Australia** (2013 – 2014) 

**Assistant Manager - GNC Health Stores** (2012 - 2013)

I worked for GNC along side being a personal trainer, furthering my knowledge of health related product. my roles included: managing various HR requirements, maintaining stock levels, recording inventory, delivery’s and customer services inclusive of complaints and query handling.

**Assistant Manager - Slaters Menswear** (2008 - 2012)

As the Assistant Manager I was predominately tasked with being the face of the store. I needed to develop strong relationships with customers to ensure repeat custom. Along side this Slaters offered free alterations, so I was to pin, measure and document any changes that need to be made accurately.

## Skills

- **Team player** - I have played all types team sports since before I can remember, because of this I feel at home being in a team of any size in any capacity. Whether that is taking a back seat and getting my head down, helping others or being at the front and leading. 

- **Fast learner/ Adaptable** - Over the last 3 months with Makers I have had to learn and use a number of different languages, frameworks and concepts. Not only this, but the languages and frameworks changed weekly some times even at different levels of software development. Because of this, I am confident that I can learn new skills and adapt to any changes quickly and effectively.

- **Problem solver** - In my spare time I enjoy gaming, especially games that have puzzle elements to them. Because of this I feel like I have spent the best part of 18 years training my problem solving skills. I often think outside of the box for solutions and love to find ways to make solutions as optimal as possible
