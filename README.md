### A bit about me
After spending the last 5 years working for a retail display and packaging company I started to understand that I needed a new challenge. I started coding to pass time on my morning commutes to and from London, after a while I realised that I actually really enjoyed what I was learning, this is when I looked to Makers to start my new life of code.

## Skills

- **Team player** - I have played all types team sports since before I can remember. Because of this I feel at home being in a team of any size in any capacity, whether that is taking a back seat and getting my head down, helping others or being at the front and leading. 

- **Hard working** - I am not afraid to get stuck in. Once I start something, no mater how difficult or time consuming, I mean to finish and give my absolute best.

**Assistant Manager - Slaters Menswear** (2008 - 2012)

As the Assistant Manager I was predominately tasked with being the face of the store. I needed to develop strong relationships with customers to ensure repeat custom.
