### A bit about me
Fun fact, after years of wanting to learn how to code, but telling myself "programming is magic and there is no way you could understand it" I decided, I fancy learning me some of this magic, loved it, quit my job of 5 years, joined [Makers](https://makers.tech/) and here I am fresh of the press a software developer!<br/>
Two things are nearly always on my mind. What shall I learn next? and what shall I have for dinner? one less important than the other, but both important to understand how my mind works.<br/> 
I want to find a position that will help answer one of those questions and offer a place where I can learn, grow and blossom into the developer im sure I can become.

## Projects

| Project | About |
|-|-|
| [Node Bank](https://github.com/ChrisCooney05/bank_tech_test) | For this project, the focus was fully on code quality and proper testing, both feature and unit.<br/> I was to build a simple banking application that was to have three  uses. Withdraw, deposit and print statement. <br/> There is no front end with this program, users interact by using the terminal and node. <br/><br/> **Tech used** <br/>  JavaScript <br/> Node <br/> Jest |
| [RoboFriends](https://github.com/ChrisCooney05/robofriends)  | This was my first exploration into using React and fetching data using an API.<br/> On receipt of data, individual cards are generated per user and rendered onto the screen. A filter box was added so that whilst a user types a name in, the applications state is updated and the cards rendered updates accordingly.<br/> Alongside learning React, it was also a great opportunity for me to explore using Tachyons for a large portion on the CSS and layout. The App can be seen in action [here](https://chriscooney05.github.io/robofriends/).  <br/><br/> **Tech used** <br/>   JavaScript  <br/> Node  <br/> React  <br/> Tachyons  |
| [CodeQuest()](https://github.com/ChrisCooney05/codeQuest)    | The final project produced by myself and 3 others as part of my Makers journey <br/> This project was different in a way as it was the first time during the course that we were given the chance to build an app of our choosing from the ground up.<br/> We decided that we wanted to produce a game for children, designed to spark an interest in code and  help develop problem-solving/explorative skills.<br/> A number of the technologies were either brand new or only partially understood by our team, so we had to work together to ensure everyone learned and developed at the same pace, whilst still keeping on track for a tight deadline.<br/> In the end I am really happy with what we came up with and that can be seen deployed [here on Netlify](https://lets-codequest.netlify.app/) <br/><br/> **Tech used** <br/>   JavaScript  <br/> Node  <br/> React  <br/> Redux <br/> Tachyons <br/> CSS <br/> Jest <br/> Travis |

## Experience

**Key Account Manager - Wine Box Company T/A WBC LTD** (October 2014 - April 2020)    
  
I started with WBC as part time member of the warehouse team. Over the next 3 years I worked myself through a number of rolls until I was promoted to Key Account Manager. I was responsible for working closely with clients, understanding briefs and delivering product that met quality, specification and budget. 

**Traveling around South-East Asia and Australia** (2013 – 2014) 

**Assistant Manager - GNC Health Stores** (2012 - 2013)

I worked for GNC along side being a personal trainer, furthering my knowledge of health related product. my roles included: managing various HR requirements, maintaining stock levels, recording inventory, delivery’s and customer services inclusive of complaints and query handling.

**Assistant Manager - Slaters Menswear** (2008 - 2012)

As the Assistant Manager I was predominately tasked with being the face of the store. I needed to develop strong relationships with customers to ensure repeat custom. Along side this Slaters offered free alterations, so I was to pin, measure and document any changes that need to be made accurately.

## Skills

- **Team player** - I have played all types team sports since before I can remember, because of this I feel at home being in a team of any size in any capacity. Whether that is taking a back seat and getting my head down, helping others or being at the front and leading. 

- **Fast learner/ Adaptable** - Over the last 3 months with Makers I have had to learn and use a number of different languages, frameworks and concepts. Not only this, but the languages and frameworks changed weekly some times even at different levels of software development. Because of this, I am confident that I can learn new skills and adapt to any changes quickly and effectively.

- **Problem solver** - In my spare time I enjoy gaming, especially games that have puzzle elements to them. Because of this I feel like I have spent the best part of 18 years training my problem solving skills. I often think outside of the box for solutions and love to find ways to make solutions as optimal as possible
