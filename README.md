I'm a junior full stack developer in training filled with both excitement and caffeine.

After spending the last 5 years working for a retail display and packaging company I was ready to make the jump into something new and exciting. My biggest motivators are seeing a project come to life and watching people interact with something I have helped develop, it gives me that little fist pump feeling and a satisfaction that canâ€™t be described. 

I have just embarked on arguably, one of the most exciting and scary times of my life studying with Makers Academy
